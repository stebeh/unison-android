# Unison Android App

This app brings the [Unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison) file-synchronization utility to Android. It can run Unison either on demand or as a background process (`-repeat watch`) that is simple to manage.

## Usage

The app needs to be provided with a Unison profile; see the [sample profile](sample.prf) or refer to the [Unison manual](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html) for advanced options. Note that many options are untested and may cause unexpected behaviour.

If your profile has a remote root, you will need to also select an (OpenSSH) key file in order to establish passwordless ssh connections. This is the private component of the key pair generated by `ssh-keygen` (and normally resides in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` on Linux systems). Please see [https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) for more information.

## (Known) limitations and bugs

* Only non-interactive (`-batch`) mode is supported.
* Symlinks on remote host will cause (non-fatal) errors due to the fact that Android's external storage does not support them. It is recommended to manually add such paths to ignore list in profile.
* Timestamps in status and logs do not respect Android's timezone. (Will probably need to be fixed by modifying binary as opposed to app.)
* See [todo](todo.md).
